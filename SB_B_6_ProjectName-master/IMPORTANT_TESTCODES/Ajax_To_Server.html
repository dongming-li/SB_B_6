<!--
This piece of code is primarily to send data from ajax JQuery
to JSP.

Its still needs to be tested and verified.

The Goal of this test is to Send an input to the JSP and it will send a response back.

I advice that the Tester remove all comments for proper function. Sometimes the comments can cause buggy codes.

		Every ajax methos has a parameter data which can be used to pass data to server
		This is the most optimal or to use and easy to understand, though its a bit large.
		
		This "$" sign is a shorten version of the word "JQuery"
		
		The [document] is the html or jsp file itself, the .ready(); means that it is active when the file is compiled and active
		
		This " $(SELECTED) " is a selector. You can use to modify [document] or any of the HTML elements like [div], [p], [body], or others.
		To do so, you first need to give it the specifics. These two following are examples.
		$("#divName") - use the elements [id] name
		$(".bodyName") - use the elements [class] name
